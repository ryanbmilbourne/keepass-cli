keepass-cli
==========

A KeePass command line tool, written in node.js

The only command line tool I could find out there was written in perl, with dodgy support for OS X, so I'm going to write one in a more portable language.

Features I'm aiming for:
- Create/edit local databases
- Support for databases stored in Dropbox and perhaps Google+
- Password generation

This project is in progress, and my first Git project from scratch, so bear with me. :)
